## 🧠 Project Overview

This project is a **Sales Analysis Dashboard** created using **Power BI**. It provides interactive and insightful visualizations based on customer order data and product details. The goal was to extract meaningful patterns to support business decisions, such as identifying high-revenue products, seasonal trends, and customer behavior across different cities and occasions.

The data was modeled efficiently to create a robust analytical structure. This dashboard allows decision-makers to filter results by delivery dates, order dates, and special occasions. With this dashboard, stakeholders can quickly understand what drives revenue, what needs improvement, and when and where customers are spending the most.
